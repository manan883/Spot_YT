Spotify playlists to YouTube playlists 
## Disclamer
This was a different way I make projects. This was a test of GPT4 and the base code was generated by GPT then modified by me 

## What is this
This will take a spotify playlist and make a youtube playlist with the same songs
###
The user will need to have api accounts set up for [spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) and for [youtube](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/youtube.googleapis.com)
The user must have a .env file in the same folder as these files and place their api keys and secrets in the env file 
The YT_CLIENT_SECRET will refer to a json file that will be downloaded when your OAuth credentials are created

### Efficiency and accuracy
Overall using GPT4 as a baseline for the project cut down development time by a lot and being able to speak to it allows for easier follow up questions. The abiliy for GPT4 to search the web played a crucial role in creating accurate and relevant answers. Errors rarely popped up mostly because this was a simple project. Any improvement that wanted to be made could be done by tossing the code back at GPT and asking to modify it. 

### Modifications done by me
The main modification I made was hiding secure data by passing in enviorement variables alongside placing the playlist function into a function so that it could be passed into main.

### Time to complete project
This took me about 2 hours to make functional and 30 minutes to run it with a GUI. Most of this time was spent getting the api's set up
