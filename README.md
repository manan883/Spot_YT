Spotify playlists to YouTube playlists 
## Disclamer
This was a different way I make projects. This was a test of GPT4 and the base code was generated by GPT then modified by me. 

## What is this
This will take a spotify playlist and make a youtube playlist with the same songs.
###
The user will need to have api accounts set up for [spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) and for [youtube](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/youtube.googleapis.com)
The user must have a .env file in the same folder as these files and place their api keys and secrets in the env file.
